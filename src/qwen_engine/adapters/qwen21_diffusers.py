"""Default local loader + Qwen-Image-2.1 diffusers adapter (M4 groundwork).

Boundary rules:

* Importing this module stays **ML-free**. ``torch``, ``diffusers`` and
  ``transformers`` are imported only inside :meth:`Qwen21DiffusersAdapter.load`,
  i.e. only on an actual run.
* Every weight comes from the verified local reference bundle
  (``manifest`` + ``models_dir`` -> :func:`resolve_local_bundle`), never from a
  repo id, an ambient Hugging Face cache or the network. The CLI has already
  resolved the same bundle once; the adapter re-resolves so it never trusts a
  caller-supplied path list, and pays the documented re-hash cost.
* Only the reviewed resident profile is implemented: unquantized FP16 on one
  V100, native SDPA, transformer + VAE resident, no text encoder in-process
  (the Qwen3-VL encoder runs in the subprocess worker), no hooks/offload.
  Q8 uses the separately verified GGUF path. Streaming remains unimplemented
  and is refused rather than silently ignored.
* The adapter **loads and attaches**; it grants no memory fit, no calibration
  and no image-quality acceptance. The measured memory policy (M5.3) remains a
  separate gate, and the CPU encoder's own conservative host-memory preflight
  still refuses until complete trusted budget evidence exists. The single
  opt-in exception is the constructor's ``trust_unbounded_host`` — the
  operator's own attestation that this process tree has no cgroup memory
  limit; it is off by default and the gate still applies a fresh
  ``MemAvailable`` read, so it can never supply a number.
* Nothing here writes outside the configured cache/output directories, changes
  a driver, touches ROCm, or flushes a global allocator on behalf of other
  processes.

        The bridge never touches the transformer again after denoise (decode
        uses the VAE, save uses the image), and this adapter is single-use, so
        releasing the reference is safe. The freed blocks stay in this
        process's own allocator cache and are reused by the decode allocation;
        no global allocator flush is performed and nothing outside this process
        is affected.

        ``pipeline.transformer = None`` is not enough on its own: diffusers
        attaches a per-module hook registry that refers back to the module, so
        the transformer survives as an unreachable reference cycle (measured:
        13.9 GiB still allocated after the assignment, 0.64 GiB after
        ``gc.collect()`` breaks the cycle). The collector runs only after the
        reference is dropped, so it cannot collect anything still in use.

        Why it matters (measured on the V100): transformer + VAE resident is
        ~14.8 GiB of 16 GiB, which leaves too little for an untiled 1024²
        decode. Untiled decode at 1024² is also measurably *better* than the
        tiled path: tiled decode leaves faint vertical dashed streaks in flat
        regions (max channel difference 52/255, mean 1.24 against the resident
        decode of the same latents), while the resident decode is clean.
        ``--tiled-decode`` therefore stays available as an explicit
        memory-first knob, not as the default.
