"""Pure W2 web contract: status / plan / editable-config-export (no sockets).

Every function here is deterministic and ML-free. The STATUS response is
served from metadata CACHED at startup — it performs no filesystem I/O at
request time. PLAN and EXPORT run the SHARED config validator, which may
STAT configured runtime-path metadata (directories only, never weight
bytes) while validating the request against the manifest. No path here
ever READS model weights or computes hashes. The only filesystem knowledge
enters through :class:`WebRuntime`, which the server validates and
canonicalises once at startup. Browser JSON can never select a runtime path — unknown
path fields are refused, not stripped.

Wire rules that are load-bearing (reviewed W2 contract):

* Public seeds are **decimal strings or null** in plan/status — never numeric
  JSON (JS ``Number`` would round past 2^53). The config export is the one
  deliberate exception: raw bytes with the exact Python uint64 number,
  downloaded as a blob and never re-serialized by the browser.
* Request seed wire: decimal ``[0-9]{1,20}`` string or null; floats, bools,
  numbers and over-long digit strings are refused typed — never parsed
  through a float and never silently rounded.
* Responses carry only schema-versioned, bounded, safe content: no runtime
  paths, no manifest filenames, no hashes, no tracebacks, no raw internal
  exception text.
