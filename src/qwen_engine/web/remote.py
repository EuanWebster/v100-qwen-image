"""Remote-port policy: proxy identity, per-user gates and the remote wire block.

The Railway container terminates TLS and Google sign-in, then forwards every
request over Tailscale with two pieces of proven identity in headers (the
shared proxy token, and the signed-in account). This module is the pure half of
that contract — no sockets, no filesystem reads at request time:

* :func:`load_proxy_token` reads the operator's 0600 secret ONCE at startup;
* :func:`tokens_match` compares it in constant time;
* :func:`parse_identity` turns the identity headers into one
  :class:`RemoteIdentity` (normalized, bounded, single-valued);
* :func:`check_feature_gates` enforces C3's per-user feature permissions
  server-side, whatever the page chose to hide;
* :func:`user_block` builds the additive status/history block the page reads.

Everything here is refused by :class:`~qwen_engine.web.api.ApiError`, so the
transport never has to translate a second error type.
